# CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups for Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.  
Focus is on methodology, reproducibility, and lessons learned â€” not just the flag.

## Structure
- `writeups/<year>-<month>-<CTF-Name>/<challenge>.md`
- `assets/` directories hold screenshots, code snippets, and payloads.

## Principles
- Publish only after the event has ended.
- Redact all flags: use `flag{redacted}`.
- No sensitive information, no live targets.

## License
- Text & images: [CC BY 4.0](LICENSE)
- Code snippets: MIT (see LICENSE-CODE)
